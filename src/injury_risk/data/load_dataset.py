"""Loading & cleaning of the real SIRP-600 dataset.

**SIRP-600** ("Sports Injury Risk Prediction", 600 athletes) was retained among
the 4 audited Kaggle candidates because it is the only one that:

- is explicitly dedicated to *risk scoring* (``Injury_Risk`` target);
- is **naturally imbalanced** (~68% low risk / 32% risk) — which justifies the
  use of SMOTE, unlike the `mrsimple07` and `university-football` datasets that
  are perfectly balanced 50/50 (an artificial balance flagged as suspicious in
  the literature).

Accepted limitations (see README): no temporal dimension (snapshot, one row =
one athlete), so **no real ACWR possible** on this dataset; binary target (not
3 classes). It serves as a "real, imperfect data" validation track alongside the
temporal synthetic dataset.

Usage:
    from injury_risk.data.load_dataset import load_sirp600
    df = load_sirp600()
